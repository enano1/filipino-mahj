   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Game

### Option 1: Run backend and frontend separately

**Terminal 1 - Backend Server:**

cd backend
npm start
```
The WebSocket server will start on `ws://localhost:3001`

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Client:**
```bash
cd frontend

### Option 2: Run both concurrently (if you install concurrently)

From the root directory:
```bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
npm run dev
```

## How to Play

### Starting a Game

   - Enter your name
   - Share the 4-character room code with 3 friends

2. **Join a Room**:
   - Click "Join Room"
   - Enter the room code
   - Enter your name

3. **Wait for Players**: Game starts automatically when 4 players join

### Gameplay

**Your Turn:**
1. Click "Draw Tile" to draw from the wall
2. If you draw a dragon, wind, or flower, you automatically redraw
3. Select a tile from your hand
4. Click "Discard Selected" to discard it

**Claiming Tiles:**
- When another player discards, you may see claim options:
  - **Pong**: Claim if you have 2 matching tiles (forms set of 3)
  - **Kong**: Claim if you have 3 matching tiles (forms set of 4)
  - **Chow**: Claim if you're next player and can form a sequence (e.g., 3-4-5)
- Click "Claim" to take the tile, or "Pass" to skip

**Winning:**
- Form 4 melds (pong/chow/kong) + 1 pair (2 identical tiles)
- The game will automatically detect and announce the winner

## Game Rules

### Valid Melds
- **Pong**: 3 identical tiles (e.g., 🀇🀇🀇)
- **Chow**: 3 consecutive tiles of same suit (e.g., 🀇🀈🀉)
- **Kong**: 4 identical tiles (e.g., 🀇🀇🀇🀇)

### Special Rules
- **Auto-redraw tiles**: Dragons (🀄🀅🀆), Winds (🀀🀁🀂🀃), Flowers (🀢🀣🀤🀥)
- **Chaos rules**: Any player can claim pong/kong from any discard
- **Chow restriction**: Only the next player can claim chow
- **Pair rule**: Cannot pong on a pair (need 4 melds + 1 pair to win)

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Server runtime
- **ws** - WebSocket library
- **uuid** - Unique ID generation

### Frontend
- **React** - UI framework
- **WebSocket API** - Real-time communication
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Make sure the backend server is running on port 3001
- Check that no firewall is blocking WebSocket connections
- If using a different port, update `WS_URL` in `frontend/src/App.js`

### Game Not Starting
- Ensure all 4 players have joined the room
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Refresh the page if disconnected

### Tiles Not Displaying
- Make sure your browser supports emoji rendering
- Try a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
